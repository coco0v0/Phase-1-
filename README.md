Timezone: Toronto Best days for me are: Weekends

Best times for me are: 12pm-8pm I am confident about this course: yes/no ? No

Do I think this project will be: easy, as hard as I make it, difficult? I think this project is difficult because I only know Javascript and processing, did not know we need to learn other coding languages

Hey! I want to tell you about these interesting things I know (did you work on a fun project? do you know other computer languages? do you have some art to share? what about something you've built?): I use processing to create a gold miner game

I am prepared to come in-person or here are my opinions and thoughts on the following: I think lecture and lab should be still virtual because covid-19 is still a problem Honestly, I think I could improve the following: Time-wise, knowing myself, I'll probably: forget to get in touch with people and fall behind but try to keep up

I have some requests regarding group members or accommodations or stuff that really makes it either hard for me to do group work or else makes group work really fun for me: Sometimes I may have other coursework to do, may not have too much time to participate in the group project
I could go outside to find content for the project: Youtube
I have some cool equipment like: Camera and Drumset
I've done some art exhibits: No
Anything else I have thoughts on regarding this project, this course, the content, or life in general: I think this course is kind of unorganized. I have many misunderstand about this course.
